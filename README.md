# Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) Tutorial

Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) is an essential approach for understanding spatial patterns and relationships in geographic data. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on how to perform ESDA using Python, focusing on techniques such as spatial autocorrelation and visualization.

## Introduction

Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) goes beyond traditional data analysis by incorporating the spatial dimension into the exploration process. Unlike conventional exploratory data analysis (EDA), which deals with tabular or time-series data, ESDA examines data with geographic coordinates or spatial units.

## Setup and Installation

Before diving into ESDA, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- plotly_express
- pysal
- splot
- descartes
- palettable
- contextily

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
!pip install pandas numpy geopandas matplotlib plotly_express pysal splot descartes palettable contextily
